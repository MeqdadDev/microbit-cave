# DHT11 Sensor

### What is DHT11 Sensor?
The DHT11 is a low-cost digital temperature and humidity sensor commonly used in electronics projects. It measures temperatures from 0°C to 50°C (32°F to 122°F) with ±2°C accuracy and humidity from 20% to 80% with ±5% accuracy. Its digital signal output makes it easy to interface with microcontrollers. The sensor is popular in weather stations, environmental monitoring, and home automation due to its affordability.
